## Next Boilerplate

This project is a template for building Next.js applications, containing my favourite stetup/structure for boosted start!

## Getting Started

###
This repository was specifically made to be used as the base for a new Next.js project, fully configured with support for Eslint, Prettier, Jest, RTL, Typescript, Styled Components AND Husky pre-configured hooks to run all tests and code linting.

### How to use
Currently, Github has an awesome guide on how to optimally use template projects [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)


### First run

After forking and downloading your own version of this boilerpalte, navigate to the repo folder and run:

```
npm install
```

Thats it! All you gotta do now is run ``` npm run dev``` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
