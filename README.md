This project is a template for building Next.js applications, containing my favourite stetup/structure for boosted start!

## Getting Started

###
This repository was specifically made to be used as the base for a new Next.js project, fully configured with support for Eslint, Prettier, Jest, RTL, Typescript, Styled Components AND Husky pre-configured hooks to run all tests and code linting.

### How to use
Currently, Github has an awesome guide on how to optimally use template projects [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)


### First run

After forking and downloading your own version of this boilerpalte, navigate to the repo folder and run:

```
npm install
```

Thats it! All you gotta do now is run ``` npm run dev``` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Useful out-of-the-box commands

**OBS:** Since I used ``` npm ```,  all of the examples are running commands with ``` npm run ```, to use yarn just replace ``` npm run ``` with ``` yarn ``` on the execution of any command, also you will need to replace any ``` npm run ```occurrencies on ``` package.json ```

### Generating components

Running ``` npm run plop ``` will prompt asking for the component name or you can run ``` npm run plop mycomponent ``` and plop will generate your component under ``` src/components ```

### Running tests

You can either run ``` npm run test ``` or ``` npm run test:watch ``` to run jest with the watch flag.
